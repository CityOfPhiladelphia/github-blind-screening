# GitHub Blind Screening

Hides names and pictures from GitHub profiles to allow 'blind screening' of
profiles for more objective candidate selection.

Note: You can still see the username in the URL. Can't think of a way around
that, but [let us
know](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/github-blind-screening/issues/new)
if you can.

## Installation

Use **Stylus** to enable this. Stylus is available for chrome or firefox.

Note: Stylish [became spyware](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/). Thus, [Stylus](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/05/16/stylus-is-a-stylish-fork-without-analytics/) is recommended instead.

Once ~~~Stylish~~~ Stylus is installed, you can install these styles from
[userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/136119/github-blind-screening).
Alternatively, you can copy & paste the css from `github-blind-screening.css`
into a new style in the ~~~Stylish~~~ Stylus browser extension manually.
